# Home Pi Performance Server

After purchasing a Raspbery Pi, I decided that I wanted to work on some projects that improved the quality of my internet use at home. There was no need to do anything major, rather I focused on fixing a few minor pain points in my life.

I focused on what was important to me: improving security, upgrading my home network speed, and increasing accessibility. With these things in mind, I set out to complete this: Ad-blocking at the network level, Home VPN access, and Remote Access to my Raspberry Pi, with both GUI and Non Gui Options.
