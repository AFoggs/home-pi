# Home Pi Performance Server

After purchasing a Raspbery Pi, I decided that I wanted to work on some projects that improved the quality of my internet use at home. There was no need to do anything major, rather I focused on fixing a few minor pain points in my life.

I focused on what was important to me: improving security, upgrading my home network speed, and increasing accessibility. With these things in mind, I set out to complete this: Ad-blocking at the network level, Home VPN access, and Remote Access to my Raspberry Pi, with both GUI and Non Gui Options.

## Ad-Blocking

One of the most painful parts of browsing the internet while at home is ads. Of course, it's nice that they are personalized, and sometimes they are actually pretty useful, showing us products that we weren't even sure we wanted, but the vast majority of the time, they are annoying.

Thankfully, someone had already come up with a solution: [**Pi-Hole**](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/vpn/installation/)

It is open source and easy to set up, and it blocks ads at the domain level. It is only heightened by Pairing it with a VPN.
